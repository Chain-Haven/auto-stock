# Windows and Security

- Use PowerShell-safe commands only: no bash env var syntax (e.g. use `$env:VAR` or cross-env in scripts).
- Supabase: Auth + RLS on every table; client never uses service_role.
- Webhook/plugin endpoints: signature verification, replay protection, idempotency.
- Secrets: encrypted at rest; master key in Vercel env vars only.
