# Testing and Milestones

- Run the smallest relevant test after every meaningful change.
- At milestone end, run full `pnpm verify` (lint + typecheck + unit + E2E). Fix until green.
- Do not start the next milestone until the current one is GREEN.
- Execute milestones M1 through M10 in order; do not skip.
- Do not remove endpoints or change existing contracts in breaking ways; extend only.
